						As you can see, he also likes bad puns.
						His other more tolerable interests include playing Nintendo games, listening to classic rock, and Hereford!
						He is excited to be one of your co-consuls this year!

			<h2>Committees</h2>

			<h3>Sustainability Committee</h3>
			<p>
				The Sustainability committee fosters the spirit of physical wellness at Hereford by planning educational programs that raise awareness of environmental issues.
				This may entail, but is not limited to, working with UVa Housing to institute physical improvements to Hereford buildings
				(e.g. efficient hand-dryers; shower timers) or providing Herefordians with re-usable dinnerware for all community-wide events to encourage sustainability.
				Members of this committee think outside of the box.

			<h3>Needs, Advocacy, Physical Space (NAPS)</h3>
			<p>
				The NAPS committee has a broad scope, but exists to fulfills the general needs of the Hereford Community.
				This committee handles both the material needs of Hereford, seeking to reimagine and enhance Hereford’s spaces,
				as well as personal needs of the Hereford student body.
				For example, the committee has responded to student calls for improvements to the Hereford Hub and halls with cooking supplies,
				new artwork, and pillows. Other projects include Hereford t-shirts and hoodies, new soccer nets,
				and personal-care bags during the final exam period.
				Members of this committee are abstract and creative thinkers.

			<h3>Social Committee</h3>
			<p>
				The goal of the Social committee is to plan and execute social events for the Hereford community.
				In addition to small one-time or recurring events,
				the Social committee is also responsible for planning two day trips (i.e. to King's Dominion and Richmond).
				The purpose of this committee is to give Herefordians a reason to come together and get more acquainted with each other and the Hereford community.

			<h3>Social Awareness Committee</h3>
			<p>
				The Social Awareness committee seeks to increase dialogue at Hereford surrounding issues of social justice,
				particularly as they pertain to members of our own community. This is done via the planning of educational programs in Hereford,
				such as lectures or open-invitation conversations with faculty members or in collaboration with other groups around Grounds.
				Creative thinking is encouraged to meet the social justice interests of Herefordians and to further awareness of these issues in the community.
