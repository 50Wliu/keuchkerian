			<p>The Hereford Student Senate (HSS)  is a body of student representatives that serves the Hereford Community. Consisting of two consuls, an executive board, and senators from each building, the Senate oversees the disbursement of the $20,000 budget consisting of student activities funds for enrichment programs, community-building activities, and improvements at the college. The Senate is the primary voice of Hereford students within the residential college as well as the larger University, helping to shape the direction of Hereford. The Senate also serves as a liaison between Hereford and the other residential colleges at U.Va. to plan joint activities.</p>
